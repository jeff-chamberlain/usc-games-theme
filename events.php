ABOUT THE CONFERENCE<br />
This year's Transmedia, Hollywood examines the ways that transmedia approaches are forcing the media industry to reconsider old production logics and practices, paving the way for new kinds of creative output. Our hope is to capture these transitions by bringing together established players from mainstream media industries and independent producers trying new routes to the market. We also hope to bring a global perspective to the conversation, looking closely at the ways transmedia operates in a range of different kinds of creative economies and how these different imperatives result in different understandings of what transmedia can contribute to the storytelling process--for traditional Hollywood, the global media industries, and for all the independent media-makers who are taking up the challenge to reinvent traditional media-making for a "connected" audience of collaborators.
<br /><br />
PANELS INCLUDE:<br />
10:00-11:50 AM: Realigned Work-Worlds: Hollywood/Silicon Valley/Madison Avenue
12:00-1:50 PM: Creative Economies: Commercial vs. State-Based Models
3:00-4:50 PM: Working on the Margins: Who Pays for Transformative Works of Art?
5:00-6:50 PM: Creative Intersections: How Comics Fit into the Transmedia Ecology

ABOUT TRANSMEDIA, HOLLYWOOD<br />
Transmedia, Hollywood is a one-day public symposium exploring the role of transmedia franchises in today's entertainment industries. Transmedia, Hollywood turns the spotlight on media creators, producers and executives and places them in critical dialogue with top researchers from across a wide spectrum of film, media and cultural studies to provide an interdisciplinary summit for the free interchange of insights about how transmedia works and what it means. Transmedia, Hollywood is co-hosted by Denise Mann and Henry Jenkins, from UCLA and USC, two of the most prominent film schools and media research centers in the nation.<br />

KEVIN BACHUS<br />
One of the best-known and most highly respected executives in the video game industry and an active investor in the digital media sector, Kevin is currently chief product officer at Bebo, one of the largest social networks in the world with over 120 million registered users. However, Kevin is probably best known as one of the original group of four individuals at Microsoft Corporation who came up with the idea for the Xbox videogame system, an initiative that grew in part out of his role as group product manager for the DirectX family of Windows technologies. As Microsoft's first director of third-party relations for Xbox, Kevin secured support for Xbox from all major game publishers worldwide and created and managed the programs and processes that would ultimately lead to the strongest software line-up ever for the launch of a game console. Prior to joining Microsoft, Kevin served in a number of business and production capacities at Mindscape, a video game industry pioneer. After leaving Microsoft, Kevin co-founded or served in an executive capacity at a number of innovative, venture-backed companies including Capital Entertainment Group, the video game industry's first independent production company; Infinium Labs, a pioneer in the field of digital software distribution whose flagship product was a finalist for Best Hardware at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo; PlayDayTV, a revolutionary Softbank-owned digital television initiative; and Nival Interactive, the largest independent game developer in Eastern Europe. Although he developed a number of games on his own during the industry's infancy, Kevin chose to attend the prestigious University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television where he majored in screenwriting and directing before combining his two passions, technology and entertainment, in the field of interactive entertainment.

CHANEL SUMMERS<br />
Chanel Summers has achieved success and renown in both the Seattle music scene and the video game industry, a unique perspective she brings to her position as co-founder of Syndicate 17, a unique music composition and audio production company based in Seattle and Los Angeles. Chanel began her career as a pioneering female game designer and producer, creating innovative products at early industry leading companies ranging from Mindscape, to Velocity (makers of the first networked video game) to Mattel Media, where she designed and developed everything from high-performance 3D vehicle simulations, to action/arcade platform games, to hardware peripherals. Recruited to Microsoft in the late '90s, Chanel was responsible for the release of that company's first multiplayer Internet game, Fighter Ace, an air combat simulation that prefigured the rise of mass online gaming.
<br /><br />
While working on Fighter Ace, Chanel became enamored of the company's transformative interactive audio technologies, and transitioned into a role as the company's first Audio Technical Evangelist, in which capacity she was responsible for launching DirectMusic, a revolutionary method of creating and delivering interactive music and sound design, and establishing programs to get audio professionals more involved in the design of Microsoft technologies. As a result, Chanel became a widely recognized figure in leading industry organizations, as well as the published author of a number of articles and technical white papers. With the inception of Microsoft's Xbox video game system in 2000, Chanel was tapped to help design and promote the audio capabilities of the new hardware platform and was instrumental in defining hardware capabilities and programming libraries, evaluating and selecting external vendors, and managing the creation of audio-specific demos that would showcase the console. As a result, Chanel discovered an untapped opportunity to secure video game industry mindshare by creating the industry's first support team for content creators: a team of graphic artists, sound designers, composers and game designers who would work with the development community, coaching game creators to take advantage of the capabilities presented by Xbox. The Content and Design Team's goal, and Chanel's mandate as its Worldwide Creative Manager, was to help game creators around the world apply technology and features into design in order to help usher in an era of future-generation games.
<br /><br />
After leaving Microsoft in 2002, Chanel focused her creative passions into drumming — a lifelong aspiration — and quickly established herself as a mainstay in the Seattle music community. Known for her energetic stage presence, impeccable timing, and extremely creative, musical drum parts, Chanel is a highly sought after performer, recording frequently and performing professionally in a number of nationally touring bands, working alongside such bands as Missing Persons, The Dreaming, Smile Empty Soul, The Last Vegas, Endless Hallway, and Vast, and showcasing in festivals ranging from CMJ to SXSW. Chanel has recently achieved additional success through the formation of Syndicate 17, a company that specializes in writing and producing original scores, cues, and sound effects for all forms of media, ranging from advertising and film/television projects, to video games and interactive music, to websites, and even songwriting for a number of well-known recording artists. Syndicate 17 prides itself on its unique, lightning-fast composition and recording processes. Consistently singled out for its speed in execution, thanks to extensive work on advertising projects with impossibly short deadlines, the company cuts down schedules and costs, often turning around major projects within a matter of hours.<br />
