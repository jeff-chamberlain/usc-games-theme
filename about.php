                        <p style="padding-right:125px;">Recognized as the #1 game design program in North America by the Princeton Review and GamePro Magazine, USC Games represents an exciting collaboration between the School of Cinematic Arts' Interactive Media Division and the Viterbi School of Engineering's Department of Computer Science. Incorporating elements of design, artistry and engineering, USC Games offers an utterly unique educational experience for students, and serves as the launching pad for them to play significant roles in the game design field. With rigorous, hands-on instruction from master designers, engineers and working professionals in the industry, students have an unprecedented level of opportunity to delve into every aspect of creating games for a global audience.</p>
                        <br />
                        The comprehensive curriculum envisions the emerging discipline of game studies as an inherently interdisciplinary effort that spans many areas of the University's curriculum and research. In addition to the degree programs in SCA's Interactive Media division and Viterbi's Computer Science department, USC Games also encompasses classes taught in SCA's John C. Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts, Division of Writing for Screen & Television, and Division of Critical Studies, USC's Roski School of Fine Arts and USC Annenberg's School for Communication & Journalism.
<br /><br />
Many USC Games alumni have forged dynamic careers either in the game design industry, or as part of their own independent start-up companies. Alumni like Sumeet Jakatdar, Jenova Chen, Kellee Santiago, Rob Cheng, and Susanna Ruiz gained valuable training and experience as USC students, enabling them to transition into the professional world.

                       <b>GAME INNOVATION LAB</b><br />
The USC Game Innovation Lab is a research space and think tank where new concepts in game design, play, and usability can be developed, prototyped and play tested in an environment separate from the timelines and constraints of commercial game development. Under the direction of Associate Professor Tracy Fullerton, the goal of the lab is to nurture concepts that push games beyond their currently defined genres, markets and play patterns and to make breakthroughs in these areas that will be valuable to lab sponsors and the industry on the whole.<br /><br />

<b>GAMPIPE LABORATORY</b><br />
Under the direction of Professor Michael Zyda, he Gamepipe Laboratory supports the full game production process, from building 3D models to motion capture, game animation, game engine development and utilization, and game design and prototype development for serious and entertainment purposes.  Participants include students from the School of Cinematic Arts Interactive Media Division and students from the Viterbi School of Engineering's Computer Science Department. Additional students providing concept art, 3D models, animation, rigging, music and sound come from all across the USC campus and from collaborating schools.<br /><br />

<b>IMD Hybrid Classroom/Lab</b><br /><br />
<b>XML</b><br />
<i>Premiere Instructional Computer Classroom/Lab Space</i><br /><br />

Used by many teachers for the development of games, XML is the premiere instructional space to try out ideas, interact with faculty, meeting place for student development projects. 18 iMacs, software, 5.1, projector, dual boot,<br /><br />

<b>YML</b><br />
<i>Intimate Community Workspace</i><br /><br />

Any game designer knows that design is about collaboration and trial and error. The YML workspace offers four projection screens so that designers can see their work in an immersive, intimate setting. The YML is the home of constant ideas, sharing and plenty of all-nighters.<br /><br />

<b>ZML</b><br />
<i>Classroom in the Round</i><br /><br />

Sometimes game design needs a large physical space. The ZML room provides personal space for movement, a large hall for guest speakers to engage students and a volume for Kinect-based motion capture. Running eight Mac Pros and five Mac Minis, the ZML provides all of the computing power needed to create industry-standard games and immersive experiences.<br /><br />


<b>KINECT DEVELOPMENT LAB</b><br /><br />
In cooperation with Microsoft, this is a dedicated Lab environment dedicated to USC's Kinect Development  in cooperation with Microsoftwith  and a feed directly to Microsoft.<br /><br />


<b>STEREOSCOPIC LAB</b><br /><br />
The Stereo Lab at USC provides the next generation technology of 3DS technology and providing a platform for students, faculty and staff to integrate the most cutting edge stereo equipment in a faculty-supported environment.<br /><br />

<b>MOTION CAPTURE STAGE</b><br /><br />
The SCA Motion Capture Stage is amongst the most sophisticated motion capture stages at a university anywhere.  The facility is set up for the capture of both body and face, and is capable of elaborate virtual production, ala AVATAR and A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Students from all disciplines within the school use the Vicon-and Xsens-based motion capture stage for both linear media as well as games and interactive media.<br /><br />
