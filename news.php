<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">Rose Family Foundation Fellowship Established at SCA</span><br />
The Interactive Media Division at the USC School of Cinematic Arts has the backing and attention of many top video game companies and personalities. This July, Activision Blizzard executive George Rose joins their ranks by establishing the Rose Family Foundation Fellowship for Interactive Entertainment.
<br /><br />
"SCA's Interactive Media Division is without peer, and produces the best and most innovative young talent," said Rose. "By establishing this Fellowship, it is my hope to direct the attention of the best and the brightest minds to not only to game design but to how the games can be used in new and unexpected ways. This area is challenging and exciting and proves that limits to game design and interactivity are truly boundless."
<br /><br />
George Rose is a veteran executive in the video game industry, spending the past 17 years with Activision Blizzard, the largest and most successful video game publisher in the world. He has served as its former Chief Public Policy Officer and Chief Legal Officer and now as Senior Consultant to the Activision Blizzard CEO. Rose is responsible for defining many of the legal and business conventions established by the video game industry and is considered one of the nation's authorities on the legal and policy issues related to children and video game play. He also held a leading role in Brown vs. EMA, a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutional right of free speech in the context of video games.
<br /><br />
The fund is intended to support, encourage and educate new voices at the USC School of Cinematic Arts by providing students with tuition and fee assistance. Over the next five years, funds will be awarded to two students per year who are enrolled in the Interactive Media Division (IMD) and are creating interactive projects within the areas of health, wellness, education or other innovative areas. The students will be known as the Rose Family Foundation Fellows.
<br /><br />
"The Rose Family's generous gift is precisely the kind of support that allows us to provide an exceptional educational environment for our students," said SCA Dean Elizabeth M. Daley. "Our Interactive Media Division is second to none in the world and the fund will go a long way to encourage deserving students to further their studies in game design and other emerging media."

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">Dennis Wixon "Interfaces" with IMD</span><br />
Ranked the number one game design school in North America by the Princeton Review and GamerPro Media for the third year running, USC's School of Cinematic Arts' Interactive Media Division is home to renowned faculty and staff. Coming this fall, IMD will add another exemplary member to its ranks in the form of user research pioneer Dennis Wixon, who will serve as the Microsoft Endowed Professor.
"I am thrilled and humbled to be joining the Interactive Media Division as the Microsoft Endowed Professor," Wixon said. "The focus on innovation makes the program exciting and relevant to [the] world of gaming and I look forward to contributing to the Division's level of excellence."
<br /><br />
IMD currently teaches several courses on user interfaces including CTIN 404, Usability Testing for Games and CTIN 410 Interface Design for Games which guide students through developing mechanics for games and testing their playability in real-world situations.
<br /><br />
With more than thirteen years at the Microsoft Corporation, Wixon's extensive innovation in design initiatives is more than impressive. Wixon has served as the founding User Research Manager for Microsoft Game Studios, Research Manager for Microsoft Surface, Senior User Researcher in their Startup Business Group, the Senior Research Lead in their Business Products Experience Group and the head of SQL Azure research and innovation. His team's innovative research methods, such as RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation) and TRUE (Tracking Real-time User Experience), have been successfully applied to the best-selling Halo franchise. In 2011, he was elected to the SIGCHI Academy, which honors leaders and shapers of the field of human-computer interaction.
<br /><br />
On Wixon's new position, Dean Elizabeth M. Daley said, "We are very pleased to have Dennis as the Microsoft Endowed Professor. His unparalleled professional accomplishments have established him as a leader and innovator in the field of game design. He is a perfect fit for the School of Cinematic Arts and the Interactive Media Division."
<br /><br />
With Wixon on board, IMD can further provide its students, faculty and staff with unparalleled support and opportunities as it continues to pave the way of interactive entertainment.

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">SCA'S IMD Reaches Uncharted Territory</span><br />
Ranked the number one game design program for the third consecutive year by the Princeton Review and GamePro Media, the USC School of Cinematic Arts' Interactive Media Division has paved the way for the innovative creation of interactive entertainment. Now, with the addition of leading game designer Richard Lemarchand to the faculty list beginning in Fall 2012, the bar has been raised even higher.
<br /><br />
Interactive Media Division Chair Tracy Fullerton said, "We're thrilled to have Richard join the School of Cinematic Arts. His creative work in the industry has been an inspiration to our students, and now he'll be bringing that same innovative thinking into our classrooms and community. It signals a next level of prestige for our program."
<br /><br />
After nearly eight years at Naughty Dog, a Sony-owned game development studio, Lemarchand will be joining the School of Cinematic Arts' Interactive Media Division to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses while also beginning the development on an experimental research game. Lemarchand distinguished himself as a top game designer from his work at Crystal Dynamics and as lead designer on all three games in the Uncharted series, the second of which, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, was the winner of ten AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards, five Game Developers Choice Awards, four BAFTAs and over 200 Game of the Year awards.
<br /><br />
Of the switch, Lemarchand explains, "I'm very excited about the new opportunities that joining SCA's Interactive Media Division will bring. It was really only a matter of time before my passion for experimental and art games led me to the door of IMD!"

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">USC RANKED NO.1 IN NATION FOR GAME DESIGN PROGRAM FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR</span><br />
For the third year in a row, The Princeton Review has named USC the top school in the nation for studying video game design for both undergraduate and graduate programs. USC has led the category every year since the list debuted in 2010.
<br /><br />
"USC comes out on top because of our focus on the artistry of game design," said Tracy Fullerton, chair of the Interactive Media Division at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, holder of the Electronic Arts Endowed Chair of Interactive Entertainment and director of the USC Game Innovation Lab. "Our faculty and students see beyond the trappings of technology and we are constantly driving the form forward."
<br /><br />
The USC Games program is a joint effort between the Interactive Media Division (IMD) at the USC School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) and the Department of Computer Science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
<br /><br />
"I believe [video games] will become the 9th Art," said IMD Graduate and game designer Jenova Chen '06. "It will become ubiquitous with a full spectrum of emotional experiences beloved by all of us. By working on team projects at the IMD, I created the student game Cloud, which is a monumental project in my career."
<br /><br />
USC Games graduates have worked on some of the world's most popular games, including the Activision juggernaut Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which broke sales records last year to become the top-selling video game in history.
<br /><br />
"This is wonderful news for our students.  We developed our joint games courses to be the best simulation of what a job in the video game industry is like and it's paid off for our graduates," said Michael Zyda, Professor of Computer Science and Director of USC's GamePipe Laboratory. In addition to producing blockbusters, IMD graduates have left an unparalleled mark in the world of indie video games including the hits Flower, fl0w and Journey.<br />

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">IMD PROFESSOR EARNS "CRED": New Music Sharing App Adds Game Mechanics to Music</span><br />
The students of the USC School of Cinematic Arts are known for their good taste and, thanks to the work of the Interactive Media Division, promoting their new favorite bands is entering the digital age.
<br /><br />
Games and music collide online in cred.fm, a Facebook game that lets you discover great tunes, meet interesting people and get bragging rights as a music tastemaker. The game was created by Research Associate Professor Chris Swain and spun off as a startup company.
<br /><br />
"It's a way of finding great music that you wouldn't have found otherwise," said Swain. "It allows people who play the game well to be recognized for their taste. It started as a research project at the university. Once it won the award, we spun it off."
<br /><br />
Among many of its perks, cred.fm allows its users to discover new music and join online parties, as well as offering the ability to earn higher Cred scores and recommend bands to their followers. Now, the effort put into seeking new bands can be recognized and rewarded, all through the convenience of a social networking site.
<br /><br />
"We know that game mechanics are very engaging," continued Swain. "We know that people are very passionate about music. Some people will do it because they care about it without any mechanics but we added it and it essentially expands who the engaged people are in the social network."

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">IMMERSING IN HUNGER: Hunger in LA makes strong presence at Sundance</span><br />
In Nonny De La Pena's new immersive journalism piece Hunger in Los Angeles, the participants experience a dramatic incident at a local food bank where a man collapses in line while waiting his turn. Hunger in LA marks a major push forward in the field of Immersion, which the USC School of Cinematic Arts has been on the forefront of for years.
<br /><br />
"Cinema technology has progressed from black and white to color to widescreen now to stereo and so on," said Mark Bolas, Associate Professor in the Interactive Media Division of the School of Cinematic Arts, and Director of the Mixed Reality (MxR) Lab at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies. "In our quest for more sensory immersion I've long pondered the question: what happens when we finally get there?"
<br /><br />
In Hunger in LA, recently on display at the Sundance Film Festival, participants wore a head mounted display, enabling the user to place him or herself inside the scene. The sounds they heard were recorded on location when the actual incident took place. The response was visceral, people felt embodied in the scene, and some participants were brought to tears when they went to help the person who had just collapsed and found they were powerless.
<br /><br />
Bolas considers, "We've pushed Immersion to the point where users expect or assume a certain amount of agency. The feeling participants had when they turn to help the victim and found they could not is profound." He continued, " Immersion has a stigma in the world of cinema because it can be seen as technology driven and not story driven; with Hunger in LA, the people were immersed because of the story, the technology put them inside with no way out and I believe that their desire for agency can motivate them beyond the confines of the story itself - the fact that Immersion will be used for social causes in the future is inevitable." Bolas added, "The piece really turned a corner for my research and for everybody in the lab."
<br /><br />
Hunger in LA was a collaboration between SCA, The Annenberg School of Journalism, USC's Institute for Creative Technologies and the MxR Lab.
<br /><br />
The project is part of a bigger initiative for virtual journalism at USC.

<span style="color:#ffcc00; text-transform:uppercase;">ANATOMY OF A GAME: SCA's new ARG "Reality Ends Here" makes splash</span><br />
We all know the traditional speech from the first day of film school. The Dean tells the incoming students, "Look to your left and to your right. These are the people that you will be spending the rest of your career working with." It's the oldest speech in the book for a reason: ask any SCA alumnus with a long record of success and they'll tell you it's true.
<br /><br />
This year, the school has taken that tradition one step farther with the interactive media-making game officially called Reality Ends Here, but known to the students simply as "The Game." On a technical level, Reality Ends Here is a fifteen-week collaborative production, alternate reality game. In layman's terms, it's a new way for students to meet, network and start working together creatively. The game came out of a committee created by Dean Elizabeth Daley to envision the future of SCA.
<br /><br />
"One key initiative for that committee was to establish a 'gateway experience' for incoming students that introduced them to the changing media landscape, the history and future of the School, the possibilities that can emerge from the SCA network of current and past students and the importance of bridging the divisions of the school while they are here, both socially and academically," said Interactive Media Division Chair Tracy Fullerton, who was one of the committee's original members, along with professors Holly Willis, Steve Anderson, Tara McPherson, Mary Sweeney, Michael Patterson and Michael Peyser. The gateway class, which is being taught by Tara McPherson, was designed by the committee to introduce a new kind of social networking for SCA students, both on and offline, that would become critical to their involvement in courses and with each other.
<br /><br />
"As the class developed, it became clear that a game layer would be a perfect way to achieve all of the goals set out by the committee without falling victim to the general survey or lecture class tradition we wanted to move beyond," Fullerton continued. The game experience was designed by iMAP Ph. D candidate Jeff Watson, IMD MFA student Simon Wiscombe and Fullerton, who together focused on creating an unique entry point to this experience, what alternate reality game designers call "the rabbit hole." 
<br /><br />
"Students got a postcard at orientation that had an old picture from SCA's original building on it and the cryptic message 'Carry your cards at all times,'" said game designer and creative director Jeff Watson. "A URL on the card led to a website that had a countdown timer on it."
<br /><br />
During orientation, a flag was flown off the balcony of the SCA Complex with Reality Ends Here's logo on it. A super 8 camera with a coded message instructing the students to report to an unmarked office on the second floor was under the flag. The students deciphered the code and found the game office. Once the students had found the game office, they could pick up their Reality "packs" – a deck of 10 playing cards, different cards for each player, that contained prompts and challenges that can be combined to create any number of creative deals.
<br /><br />
For example, one student might have a card challenging them to make a "30-second short."  Another student could have a connecting card that with the property "in an elevator," and a third student has another connecting card that stipulates that they must "use the colors black and white."  The cards are each worth points, with bigger deals generating higher scores.  All students who participate in the deals get the total number of points in the deal. Collaboration was the key to success. Once a deal is struck, the students all work together to answer the challenge described by the prompt they've created.  Some deals include cards that prompt them to meet and involve other freshman, or to link multiple projects together from various divisions – such as a shared story universe between a game, a video and a poster.
<br /><br />
Once students have created a piece of media for a deal, they upload it to the game website at reality.usc.edu.  They also have to come into the game office to show the cards that they used to make the deal and film a "justification" video.  In the justification video, the students have to describe their deal and how each of the cards applies to the projetc. Each week, the students with the most points are rewarded with a very special prize: an encounter with an SCA alumnus or other well-known media maker.
<br /><br />
Some of the encounters that students have had so far include meetings with director John Singleton, screenwriter John Watson, cinematographer Dante Spinotti, game designers Kellee Santiago and Jenova Chen, writer/director John Waters and a visit to the set of Mad Men with writer Erin Levy. The students have universally said that the game and the reward encounters have opened their eyes to both the future and the history of media making.<br />
